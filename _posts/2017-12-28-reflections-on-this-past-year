# It's been a crazy year

Not only have I grown more as a person, I've also got a full time job, a wife, a child, and now a side business and more servers to handle. This isn't a big issue for me, but I'm super glad things have gone this way.

## I admit, it's been rocky

Life's been full of ups and downs, but at the end of the day, I have my wonderful wife who I love, and my child - the greatest thing that's happened to me. I've been learning at lot more about myself, like how I used to hate cold food, now I just don't mind if I do or don't. 

## Where do I even begin with Christmas?

Christmas this year, was incredible. The best gift of all, was being able to be with my family, and the newest member of the family - my little child.

## What's my plans for the new years?

I'd like to grow my business, acquire one or two customers, and give them fully managed support. I'd also like to advertise my custom development services, and ideally give some traction to my blog here, and help other developers out.

# My Goal

1. Contribute to 100 open source projects by 2018

2. Donate some money every year on behalf of my business to OSS or charity

3. Continue learning more development

4. Continue on the path to learning more C and reverse engineering

5. Finish learning Assembly (HLA)

# Happy New Year!
