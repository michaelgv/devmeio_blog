Merry Christmas to all! I've decided to blog today about this super cool drone, it's a Propel Maximum X01 Micro Drone, an inexpensive but powerful drone. It isn't apart of my tech blogging, but it's a pretty neat piece of technology.

## What's the X01 Micro Drone?

[The drone, seen here,](https://www.walmart.ca/en/ip/propel-maximum-x01-black-micro-drone/6000197017249) is a three-speed power drone, I've had time to test it and it rocks! It includes a remote control, and the drone itself is as big as a raspberry pi (in fact, a bit smaller!) and virtually the same height as a raspberry pi. 

It has three speeds, it's a bit difficult initially to get the hang of, but once you figure out the controls it really flys. It has about 20 minutes of flight time I've noticed, this is **solid** flight time, and running time without flying it about 35-45 minutes.

I would recommend all who are interested in small portable drones, that aren't expensive (sub-$30 CAD) to get this drone. It won't disappoint!
